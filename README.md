## Bias and Size Effect

The calculation of the statistic and size effect has been adapted from [Lauscher and Glavas (SEM* 2019)](https://github.com/umanlp/XWEAT). Please, use ```runCaweat.sh``` specifying the languages to consider (LANGID in the [CA-WEAT file](data/CA-WEATv1.tsv)) and the embedding model. Feel free to change the number of permutations to calculate p-values or the number of bootstraps for confidence intervals. If your embedding model has the vocabulary lowercased use the option ```--lower```.

### Tables and Plots

Results for the 16 embedding models and the 91 lists used in the paper are collected in ```plots/collectedData.csv```  and the script ```plots/plotCollectedData.py``` can be used to generate the plots and tables in a straightforward manner.
